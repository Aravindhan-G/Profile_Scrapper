# Profile Scrapper

## Introduction:
LinkedIn is a Social Networking site with over 750 million users. The User Data is valuable as it can be used to conduct various research. LinkedIn has deployed a strict Anti-Scraping system which makes direct data scraping almost impossible.

The main goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can bypass anti-scraping
algorithms and to extract data of alumni of a particular organization and of a particular domain. Selenium, BeautifulSoup libraries in Python are used. This is used to automate the complete process.

The program runs and store the scrapped data as.csv file in your current working directory.

##Libraries:
