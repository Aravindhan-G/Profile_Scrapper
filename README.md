# Profile Scrapper

## Introduction:
LinkedIn is a Social Networking site with over 750 million users. The User Data is valuable as it can be used to conduct various research. LinkedIn has deployed a strict Anti-Scraping system which makes direct data scraping almost impossible.

The main goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can bypass anti-scraping algorithms and to extract data of alumni of a particular organization and of a particular domain. Selenium, BeautifulSoup libraries in Python are used. This is used to automate the complete process.

<b>The program scraps user data in a specified domain for the specified institute and stores the scrapped data as a CSVfile in your current working directory.</b>

## Libraries:
```bash
# Install Scrapping tolls.
pip install selenium
pip install bs4

# Install api
pip install linkedin_api
```
